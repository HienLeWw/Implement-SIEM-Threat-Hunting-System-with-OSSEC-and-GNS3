# SIEM & Threat Hunting With OSSEC

## Graphical Network Simulator-3 (GNS3):
GNS3 is used by hundreds of thousands of network engineers worldwide to emulate, configure, test and troubleshoot virtual and real networks. GNS3 allows you to run a small topology consisting of only a few devices on your laptop, to those that have many devices hosted on multiple servers or even hosted in the cloud.

## OSSEC Features:
- **Log based Intrusion Detection (LIDs)**: Actively monitors and analyzes data from multiple log data points in real-time

- **Rootkit and Malware Detection**: Process and file level analysis to detect malicious applications and rootkits

- **Active Response**: Respond to attacks and changes on the system in real time through multiple mechanisms including firewall policies, integration with 3rd parties such as CDNâ€™s and support portals, as well as self-healing actions

- **Compliance Auditing**: Application and system level auditing for compliance with many common standards such as PCI-DSS, and CIS benchmarks

- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)**: For both files and windows registry settings in real time not only detects changes to the system, it also maintains a forensic copy of the data as it changes over time.

- **System Inventory**: Collects system information, such as installed software, hardware, utilization, network services, listeners and other information.
  
## Network Architecture & Configurations:
We simulate a small office network architecture which consists of 3 VLANs (Internal, Management, DMZ) and some typical networks devices (Router, Switch)
- **Router/Firewall**: Fortigate 7.0.14 (1 vCPU, 2GB RAM)
- **Switch**: CiscoIOSvL215 (1 vCPU, 768MB RAM)
- **OSSEC Server (Manager)**: Ubuntu 20.04 (2 vCPU, 2GB RAM)
- **Web Server**: Ubuntu 20.04 (2 vCPU, 2GB RAM)
- **File Server**: Ubuntu 20.04 (1 vCPU, 1GB RAM)
- **Staff Workstaion**: Windows 7 (2 vCPU, 2GB RAM)
- **VLAN 10 (Internal Network)**: This is the internal network which consists of Staff Workstation
- **VLAN 20 (Management)**: OSSEC Server is placed in seperated VLAN
- **VLAN 30 (DMZ)**: We simulate the DMZ of a small office network architect which consists of Web Server, File  Server

## Step-by-step deployment:
### Network Architecture in GNS3:
- Network Architecture: download and install necessary appliance from https://gns3.com/marketplace/appliances
- Fortigate:
  +  WAN interface (port 1) config:
  ```
    conf sys int
    edit port1
    set mode dhcp
    set allowaccess http https ping ssh
    set role wan
    end
  ```
  + We have finished configuring WAN interface of Fortigate. Now, we can access Fortigate Web Interface by using port1 IP Address
  +  LAN interface (port 2): Create 3 interfaces for 3 VLANs
  +  Configure each VLANs
  +  Configure Firewall Policy 
     +  VLAN1: allowed to access Internet and communicate with DMZ, VLAN2
     +  VLAN2: allowed to access Internet and communicate with DMZ, VLAN1
     +  VLAN3: allowed to access Internet (for packages installation), communicate with VLAN1, VLAN2
     +  Allow HTTP traffic from Internet to DMZ (forward traffic from WAN Interface to Web Server IP address)
- VLAN & Trunking Config (Switch CiscoIOSvL2):
  + Gi0/0 (connected to port 2 of Fortigate):
  ```
  enable
  conf t
  int Gi0/0
  switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
  switchport mode trunk
  ```
  + Gi0/1 (VLAN 10):
  ```
  enable
  conf t
  int Gi0/1
  switchport mode access
  switchport access vlan 10
  ```
  + Gi0/2 (VLAN 20):
  ```
  enable
  conf t
  int Gi0/2
  switchport mode access
  switchport access vlan 20
  ```
  + Gi0/3 (VLAN 30 - Web Server):
  ```
  enable
  conf t
  int Gi0/3
  switchport mode access
  switchport access vlan 30
  ```
  + Gi1/0 (VLAN30 - File Server):
  ```
  enable
  conf t
  int Gi1/0
  switchport mode access
  switchport access vlan 30
  ```
- Note: Turn off NAT routing between VLAN in order for OSSEC Agent to easily connect to OSSEC Server without error
### Update system and install necessary packages:
- Update the system:
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```
- Install necessary packages:
```
sudo apt install -y php php-cli php-common libapache2-mod-php apache2-utils sendmail inotify-tools apache2 build-essential gcc make wget tar zlib1g-dev libpcre2-dev libpcre3-dev unzip libz-dev libssl-dev libpcre2-dev libevent-dev build-essential mysql-server git vim php7.2-gd php7.2-mysql
```
### OSSEC Server Installation:
- Enable & Start Apache
```
sudo systemctl enable apache2
sudo systemctl start apache2
sudo a2enmod rewrite
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```
- Run the following commands to install OSSEC Server (3.6.0) 
```
wget https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/archive/3.6.0.tar.gz
sudo tar -xvzf 3.6.0.tar.gz
sudo /home/hgadmin/ossec-hids-3.6.0/install.sh
```
- Or install the lastest using apt
```
wget -q -O - https://updates.atomicorp.com/installers/atomic | sudo bash

# Update apt data
sudo apt-get update

# Server
sudo apt-get install ossec-hids-server

# Agent
sudo apt-get install ossec-hids-agent
```
  + Then, provide our preferred input as prompted

OSSEC is located at ```/var/ossec```. To manage the agents and run specific OSSEC command: ```/var/ossec/bin``` 
  + Install Web User Interface
```
cd /tmp/
sudo git clone https://github.com/ossec/ossec-wui.git
sudo mv /tmp/ossec-wui /var/www/html
cd /var/www/html/ossec-wui
```
  + Set the permissions
```
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/ossec-wui/
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/ossec-wui/

# Restart Apache and launch Web User Interface
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```
  + Run ```/var/ossec/bin/ossec_control start```

Now, we can access OSSEC Web UI at http://servers-ip/ossec-wui


### OSSEC Agent Installation:
- For Windows:
  + Download OSSEC Agent 3.6.0 for Windows at: https://updates.atomicorp.com/channels/atomic/windows/ossec-agent-win32-3.6.0-12032.exe
  + Download latest version at https://www.ossec.net/download-ossec/ (navigate to Windows tab)
  + Run setup wizard and follow the direction to complete the installation. 
- For Linux:
  + Follow the installation steps of OSSEC Server
  + At "provide our preferred input as prompted" step, we specify the kind of installation as agent (instead of server)
- Connect agent to server:
  + OSSEC Server:
    + Run ``` /var/ossec/bin/manage_agents```
    + Add agent
    + Extract key
  + OSSEC Agent (Windows):
    + Run OSSEC Agent Manager
    + Provide Server's IP and import key from OSSEC Server
    + Restart OSSEC Agent
    + Restart OSSEC Server ```/var/ossec/bin/ossec_control restart```
  + OSSEC Agent (Linux):
    + Run ```/var/ossec/bin/manage_agents```
    + Provide Server's IP and import key from OSSEC Server
    + Restart both OSSEC Agent and OSSEC Server ```/var/ossec/bin/ossec_control restart```

### Web Server:
In order to simualate a website with existing vulnerabilities, we install Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA):
- Navigate to /var/www/html: ```cd /var/www/html```
- Clone DVWA repository ```git clone https://github.com/digininja/DVWA.git```
- Change directory name: ```mv DVWA/ dvwa/```
- Navigate to DVWA config directory: ```cd dvwa/config```
- Change config file name```mv config.inc.php.dist config.inc.php```
- Modify php.ini file: make sure **allow_url_include** and **allow_url_open** is setted to "On"
- Restart apache2: ```sudo systemctl restart apache2``` or ```sudo systemctl restart apache2.service```
- Modify database configuration of DVWA: ```cd /var/www/html/dvwa/config``` then using nano or vim to modify config.inc.php ```nano config.inc.php```
  - Change **db_user** to **root**
  - Change **db_password** to **""**
- Run ```mysql -u root```  then ```use mysql;```
- ```ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY '';```
- Access DVWA at http://localhost/dvwa/setup.php
- Click **Create/Reset database** then **login**
Now, setup is completed. DVWA is ready.
### File Server:
Install WebDAV
- Enable WebDAV
```
sudo a2enmod dav
sudo a2enmod dav_fs
sudo systemcrl restart apache2.service
```
- Create sharing directory:
```
sudo mkdir /var/www/webdav/Documents
sudo mkdir /var/www/webdav/Downloads
```
Or, we can set up File Server by installing Samba
